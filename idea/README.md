The Data in any application can be categorized as STRUCTURED and UNSTRUCTURED Data. 
The Structured part of the data can be tackled using any of the open source OCR with good accuracy. And for the Unstructured part of the data the functioning of the OCR should be modified as to identify the Images, signatures etc so as to store them separately together.
In case if the type of document is OVDs (like aadhaar card,PAN card etc) sensitive data like the aadhaar no. can be masked when placing in the document and the original document is stored securely elsewhere.
The software is a webapp/website which accepts the Document which is scanned as input.
OCR operations will be performed on the document and the resultant file will be give to the user as output.
Sample documents as per various document type / language / format, etc.
Sample scanned document / image format:
1. JPEG
2. PDF
3. TIFF
