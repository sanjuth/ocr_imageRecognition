Due to many different operations going on in a Bank ,there exist many types of documents which go around in a bank. Sometimes it becomes very inconvenient to store the different type of documents separately. This creates a large inefficiency in operation time and storage space.
Hence we are here to create a software that can scan different types of documents and store all the structured and unstructured information in a common file format.
The common file format will contain the type of application/file which was scanned, all the main structured text in one place, values with common tags will be stored together. All the images, photographs etc will be stored in separate section with appropriate tags for identification.
This makes it easier for the banks to organize different types of documents together, saving both time and space.
This also allows the banks to search for any information of any user in the document conveniently. Also the information can be stored efficiently using this.

To improve the accuracy of the document we use deep learning with OCR to differentiate between the structured and the unstructured data.
This is a unique idea to classify the different types of data and grouping the common data together.
